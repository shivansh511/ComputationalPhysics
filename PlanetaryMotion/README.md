# Planetary Motion

Planar motion of a planet is an example of coupled second order ordinary differential equations. Second order differential equations can be solved numerically using fourth-order Runge-Kutta(also called RK4) method. Here is c++ program to solve two coupled second order ordinary differential equations usign RK4 method.
The data is stored in a file named "orbitdata.csv" and it can be visualized using the python script "data.py".
